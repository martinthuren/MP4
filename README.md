# MP4 - Business Intelligence - MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF ATTRITION

## Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?
We used a logistic regression model, for predicting employee attrition. Logistic Regression is good for binary tasks. 

## How accurate is your solution of prediction?

We think the accuracy went pretty well. The obtained accuracy was close to 87%. This indicates that the model works at either showing how likely employees where to leave.

## Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?

The most decisive factor for quitting a job was how many years people have stayed at a company.

## Which work positions and departments are at higher risk of losing employees?

## Does education make people happy (satisfied with the work)?

It seems that people with higher education have a higher satisfaction. People with mid-education have the worst satisfaction, and then it begins to rise again as the education drops.

## What were the challenges in the project development?
The challenges have been to know what to look for in the dataset, and we had to figure out all new libraries to make it work.
